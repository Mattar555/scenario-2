## Notes

Note, this particular operator is meant to serve a production ready deployment of PGSQL. There are settings such as high availability, replica count, backups, security, persistence, authentication and so on and so forth.

This deployment is pretty minimal. Just be aware one can simply configure the settings in the YAML as per requirements.
