## Introduction to Cluster

If you're completely new to the concept of clusters, do follow the quick and easy tutorial [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_tutorial) to learn more.
> With Red Hat® OpenShift® on IBM Cloud®, you can create highly available clusters with virtual or bare metal worker nodes that come installed with the Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud Container Platform orchestration software. You get all the advantages of a managed offering for your cluster infrastructure environment, while using the Red Hat OpenShift tooling and catalog that runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux for your app deployments.

## Introduction to OpenShift

OpenShift is a platform that allows you to run containerized applications and workloads and is powered by Kubernetes. 
It is an offering that comes with Red Hat support, irrespective of where the workloads are situated.

For developers or cluster administrators, OpenShift has two different ways of enabling them to work with their platform.
This includes the CLI and the Web Console. We will be leveraging both operational mediums throughout this exercise.
